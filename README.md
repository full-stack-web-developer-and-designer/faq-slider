# FAQ Slider
This is the **jQuery FAQ Accordion Slider** repository that contains a list of 5 questions with answers.
The answers are initially hidden and when you click on a question, the answer will be displayed and scroll down.
This project is built using the jQuery next(), siblings(), children(), slideUp(), slideDown() and slideToggle() methods.
Questions have a small arrow next to them and when you click on a question the arrow will rotate down.

Also, for the footer copyright notice, the current year is set using the Date object and the getFullYear() method.

This project is done with semantic HTML5 markup, CSS styling and various mentioned jQuery methods.
