### 📌 About

This project implements a dynamic FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) slider/accordion: a list of questions that can be clicked to expand or collapse the answer. It uses minimal code — pure HTML, CSS for styling and JS for interactive behavior — making it easy to integrate into any static website or project.

It’s perfect for FAQs on landing pages, portfolios, documentation sections, or any site needing collapsible informational content without heavy dependencies.
